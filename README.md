# Customer Churn Prediction Project

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](#license)

## 🧾 Project Overview

Customer churn — when customers stop using a product or service — is a key concern for subscription-based businesses (telecom, SaaS, utilities). Predicting churn helps companies take proactive action (retention marketing, personalized offers) to reduce attrition and revenue loss.

In this project, I built an **end-to-end churn prediction pipeline** using:

- **Python / Machine Learning** for predictive modeling  
- **SQL** for data storage, querying, and feature extraction  
- **Excel** for exploratory analysis and pivot-based KPIs  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and insights
